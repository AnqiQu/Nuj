# Nuj
# Made by Anqi Qu (2019)

A goal-tracking app, reimagined. 
To provide support, to motivate, to help take care of mental health, and to nudge people towards greater productivity. 
That is the philosophy behind Nuj, which is designed as a platform for users to track and manage their goals, 
with a particular focus on motivation, support and self-care. 
Nuj was designed thoughtfully, 
with the understanding that motivation and productivity are some of the greatest daily challenges, 
particularly for those who are struggling with their mental health. 

Users can create goals for themselves, and then check them off as completed. 
Goals can be rated on a sliding scale of difficulty which helps users to prioritise. 
All goals are stored in a permanent database and displayed in a list, which helps users stay organised and focused on their goals. 
Users are encouraged to break down big, overwhelming goals into smaller goals which are easier to manage and complete

Nuj tracks the number of goals you complete each week, so if it detects a drop in productivity, it can let you know. 
A sudden decrease in motivation - and consequently productivity - could be a warning sign of a more serious health issue.  
Nuj will also display appropriate messages of praise and encouragement, and motivate users to maintain their productivity streak

Nuj also provides tips for users about how to take care of their mental health, 
as well as steps showing users how to seek help if needed. 
There are also tips and information for people who wish to help others take care of their mental health.
